# DBX MCP Server

Rust-powered Model Context Protocol server for [DBX](https://github.com/t8y2/dbx). It lets MCP-compatible AI agents inspect schemas and run safe database operations using connections configured in DBX.

[中文说明](#中文说明) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dbx-app/mcp-server) | [Native releases](https://github.com/t8y2/dbx/releases?q=packages-v)

## Architecture

```text
@dbx-app/mcp-server
└── small Node.js launcher
    └── platform-specific Rust dbx-mcp binary
        └── dbx-core database and agent infrastructure
```

The MCP protocol, connection loading, SQL safety, schema access, Redis support, MongoDB shell parsing, Web backend access, and database execution are implemented in Rust. Node.js is used only by the npm launcher so existing `npm`, `npx`, and MCP client configurations continue to work.

## Features

- **18 MCP tools** for connection and database discovery, schemas, SQL, Redis, sessions, messages, and DBX UI integration
- **Precompiled native binaries** with no local Rust, Cargo, Python, or C/C++ build requirement
- **No `better-sqlite3` runtime dependency** and no Node native-addon ABI coupling
- **Local, Web, and Docker modes** using the same tool interface
- **Optional Streamable HTTP transport** protected by a bearer token, while stdio remains the default
- **Direct native execution** for supported SQL, Redis, and MongoDB connections
- **Agent/JDBC database support** through DBX agent infrastructure when the required agent and JRE are installed
- **DBX-managed access policy** with a connection allowlist and three execution modes
- **SQL, Redis, and MongoDB safety controls** that reload the policy for every request
- **Offline execution** through downloadable native binaries
- **Optional desktop integration** for opening tables and displaying query results in DBX

## Installation

### npm global install

```bash
npm install -g @dbx-app/mcp-server
```

Then configure the MCP client to run:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbx": {
      "command": "dbx-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### npx

No global installation is required:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dbx-app/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

The npm package automatically installs the native package matching the current operating system and CPU. Do not install with `--no-optional`, because npm optional dependencies carry the platform binary.

### Native binary / offline install

Every package release publishes native archives and `SHA256SUMS` in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/t8y2/dbx/releases?q=packages-v):

| Platform | Release asset | npm platform package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `dbx-mcp-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` | `@dbx-app/mcp-darwin-arm64` |
| macOS Intel | `dbx-mcp-darwin-x64.tar.gz` | `@dbx-app/mcp-darwin-x64` |
| Linux glibc ARM64 | `dbx-mcp-linux-arm64-gnu.tar.gz` | `@dbx-app/mcp-linux-arm64-gnu` |
| Linux glibc x64 | `dbx-mcp-linux-x64-gnu.tar.gz` | `@dbx-app/mcp-linux-x64-gnu` |
| Windows ARM64 | `dbx-mcp-win32-arm64.zip` | `@dbx-app/mcp-win32-arm64` |
| Windows x64 | `dbx-mcp-win32-x64.zip` | `@dbx-app/mcp-win32-x64` |

Verify a Unix archive before extracting it:

```bash
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
tar -xzf dbx-mcp-linux-x64-gnu.tar.gz
chmod +x dbx-mcp
```

On macOS, use `shasum -a 256` if `sha256sum` is unavailable. On Windows, use `certutil -hashfile <archive> SHA256` and compare the value with `SHA256SUMS`.

Configure the MCP client to run the extracted file directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbx": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/dbx-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Direct native execution does not require Node.js. GitHub package releases are intentionally not marked as the repository's latest release, so they do not replace the latest DBX desktop release.

## Requirements

### npm installation

- Node.js 18.18.0 or newer
- A supported operating system and CPU from the platform table
- npm optional dependencies enabled

### Native installation

- No Node.js or npm requirement
- Linux builds currently require glibc; Alpine/musl is not supported yet

### Database configuration

DBX MCP reads connection profiles from DBX storage. DBX does not need to remain open for native connections. However:

- the connection must already exist in DBX storage, unless it is added through `dbx_add_connection`;
- DBX Agent/JDBC databases require the matching agent, JDBC driver, and JRE to be installed;
- `dbx_open_table` and `dbx_execute_and_show` require a running DBX desktop application;
- DBX Web mode requires a reachable DBX Web server.

## Usage Examples

Ask the MCP client to:

- "List my DBX connections"
- "Show tables in the production PostgreSQL connection"
- "Describe the `orders` table"
- "Build schema context for the billing database"
- "Count orders created in the last seven days"
- "Run `INFO memory` on the Redis connection"
- "Find the latest MongoDB documents in the events collection"
- "Open the orders table in DBX"

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dbx_list_connections` | List connections visible to the MCP session |
| `dbx_list_databases` | List databases available through a connection, respecting its MCP database scope |
| `dbx_add_connection` | Add a connection to DBX storage |
| `dbx_duplicate_connection` | Duplicate a DBX connection with its complete settings |
| `dbx_remove_connection` | Remove a connection from DBX storage |
| `dbx_list_tables` | List tables, views, collections, or message queue topics |
| `dbx_describe_table` | Return columns and table metadata |
| `dbx_list_routines` | List stored procedures and functions in a schema, with an optional `routine_type` filter (PROCEDURE or FUNCTION) |
| `dbx_get_routine_source` | Return the source of a stored procedure or function by name, with an optional `signature` for overloaded names |
| `dbx_get_schema_context` | Return compact schema context suitable for an AI model |
| `dbx_execute_query` | Execute SQL or a supported MongoDB shell command, returning 100 rows by default (up to 1000 with the `max_rows` parameter) |
| `dbx_execute_batch` | Execute a SQL script containing multiple statements in one call, returning a result per statement (or a single merged result with `use_transaction` on a multi-statement script) |
| `dbx_open_session` | Open a stateful SQL query session pinned to one backend connection |
| `dbx_close_session` | Close a session and release its pinned connection resources |
| `dbx_execute_redis_command` | Execute a Redis command |
| `dbx_salesforce_current_user` | Show the Salesforce user and org behind a connection, including the "Modify All Data" flag |
| `dbx_salesforce_prepare_write` | Prepare one Salesforce record write and return a summary plus a single-use confirm token |
| `dbx_salesforce_apply_write` | Apply a prepared Salesforce write using its confirm token |
| `dbx_peek_messages` | Read Kafka messages without committing consumer offsets |
| `dbx_send_message` | Send a message to a supported message queue topic |
| `dbx_open_table` | Open a table in the running DBX desktop application |
| `dbx_execute_and_show` | Execute a query and display the result in the DBX desktop application |

When connection scoping is enabled, mutating connection tools and desktop UI tools are hidden.

`dbx_execute_query` accepts an optional `max_rows` parameter (1–1000, default 100; out-of-range values are clamped, not rejected). It applies to SQL connections only: MongoDB shell commands always return at most 100 rows, and multi-statement scripts routed to the batch executor return at most 100 rows per statement.

`dbx_peek_messages` reads a Kafka topic in local or Web mode when `mq-admin` is enabled. Pass `connection_id` or `connection_name`, `topic`, optional `count` (1–100, default 20), `start_position` (`latest` by default, `earliest`, or `offset`), and optional non-negative `partition`. A non-negative `offset` is required only in offset mode; without a partition it applies to all partitions. The JSON response preserves base64 payloads and metadata, reports broker partial reads via `incomplete`, and reports whole-message omissions under a 256 KiB output budget via `outputTruncated`. It respects connection/tool scopes and permits read-only and production reads without committing consumer offsets. It does not support other MQ types or continuous subscriptions.

`dbx_list_databases` returns only database names allowed by the selected connection's MCP database scope. `dbx_send_message` is available when message-queue support is included in the server build.

Salesforce connections take SOQL through `dbx_execute_query` and list objects through `dbx_list_tables`. `dbx_execute_batch` and `dbx_open_session` are refused: SOQL is read-only, and every call is a stateless REST request with no session to pin. A record write is a two-step confirmed operation — `dbx_salesforce_prepare_write` returns a summary plus a single-use `confirm_token` that expires after 5 minutes, a person approves that summary, and `dbx_salesforce_apply_write` sends exactly the prepared statement. Preparing needs the per-connection **Allow DML** switch in DBX Settings → MCP, which is off by default, and Salesforce cannot roll an applied write back.

## Resources

Clients that support MCP Resources can read the connection catalog and expand templates for database metadata:

| Resource URI | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dbx://connections` | Connections visible to the current MCP scope |
| `dbx://connections/{connection_id}/databases` | Databases visible through one connection |
| `dbx://connections/{connection_id}/tables{?database,schema}` | Tables and views in an optional database/schema |
| `dbx://connections/{connection_id}/table-schema{?database,schema,table}` | Column definitions for a table; `table` is required |

Resource discovery and reads reuse the corresponding Tool allowlist plus connection, group, database, and runtime scopes. Query parameter values must be URI encoded. SQL execution and all write-capable operations remain Tools.

## Execution Modes

### Local native mode

This is the default. MCP reads DBX connection storage and executes supported connections locally in the Rust process.

Common native paths include PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, compatible SQL databases, Redis standalone, and MongoDB. SSH, cluster, vendor-specific, or Agent/JDBC connections may require additional DBX infrastructure.

DuckDB runs through the standalone DBX DuckDB driver. Install it from DBX Driver Manager before using a DuckDB connection through local MCP. The MCP binary includes the sidecar client but does not bundle the DuckDB engine.

DBX connection storage defaults to:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.dbx.app/dbx.db`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/com.dbx.app/dbx.db`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\com.dbx.app\dbx.db`

Override the directory with `DBX_DATA_DIR`.

### Agent/JDBC databases

Databases such as Dameng, KingbaseES, Oracle, DB2, Hive, Trino, Snowflake, SAP HANA, and other DBX Agent profiles use DBX's Java agent infrastructure rather than a Node.js database driver.

The native npm/GitHub binary does not bundle every proprietary JDBC driver or JRE. Install the database agent through DBX first, or provide a compatible agent installation under the DBX agent directory. Availability depends on the installed driver and license terms of the database vendor.

### DBX Web / Docker mode

Set `DBX_WEB_URL` to use a deployed DBX Web backend instead of local desktop storage:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbx": {
      "command": "dbx-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "DBX_WEB_URL": "https://dbx.example.com",
        "DBX_WEB_PASSWORD": "your-web-login-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`DBX_WEB_PASSWORD` is the password used on the DBX Web login page. Desktop-local mode does not use it. Desktop UI tools are hidden in Web mode.

DBX Web requests honor the standard system proxy environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY`, bypass via `NO_PROXY`); an empty value means no proxy. Proxies requiring authentication use the `http://user:pass@host:port` URL form. Extra headers can be attached via `DBX_WEB_HEADERS` (a JSON object, e.g. `{"Authorization":"Bearer <token>"}`) — applied to every request, including authentication. For self-signed HTTPS backends, set `DBX_WEB_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=1` to skip certificate verification, or `DBX_WEB_CA_CERT` to trust a private CA (verification is on by default).

Docker and DBX Web also require the standalone DuckDB driver. Install it from Driver Manager after the first launch; when `/app/data` is persisted, the driver is stored under `/app/data/agents` and survives container upgrades.

### Native Streamable HTTP

The native server uses stdio by default. To host a local Streamable HTTP endpoint instead, start it with a bearer token:

```bash
DBX_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN=replace-with-a-long-random-secret dbx-mcp-server --http
```

It listens on `http://127.0.0.1:5225/mcp` by default. Configure an HTTP-capable MCP client with that URL and `Authorization: Bearer <token>`:

```json
{
  "type": "http",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5225/mcp",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer replace-with-a-long-random-secret"
  }
}
```

The default loopback address accepts only clients on the same computer. Binding to a non-loopback address requires all of the following: `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`, the `--http-allow-remote` flag, and non-empty `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` plus `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` allowlists. Use exact public Host authorities and browser Origins.

DBX Web can host native Streamable HTTP on its existing listener, rather than opening a second port. On a single password-protected Web instance, enable it in **Settings → MCP → HTTP Service** with the public Host allowlist; the generated token is encrypted in DBX's secret store and can be rotated there. For multi-instance or deployment-managed setups, set `DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN` (or `DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN_FILE`) and `DBX_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` in the deployment. Deployment secrets take precedence and make the page read-only. For a container published as `4225:4224`, the endpoint is `http://localhost:4225/mcp`:

```yaml
environment:
  DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN: replace-with-a-long-random-secret
  DBX_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS: localhost:4225
ports:
  - "4225:4224"
```

Clients send `Authorization: Bearer <DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN>`. Browser clients also require an exact `DBX_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` entry. When a reverse proxy adds a path prefix, set `DBX_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`; the endpoint becomes `<base-path>/mcp`. Native HTTP and the `DBX_WEB_URL` stdio adapter can coexist and share the same DBX policy.

### Windows portable DBX

Point `DBX_DATA_DIR` at the portable `data` directory containing `dbx.db`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbx": {
      "command": "dbx-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "DBX_DATA_DIR": "D:\\DBX_x64-portable\\data"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## DBX-managed MCP Policy

DBX stores one authoritative policy under **Settings → MCP** and reloads it for every request:

| Permission mode | Allowed operations |
| --- | --- |
| Read only | Queries and metadata reads |
| Data read/write | Regular inserts, effectively filtered updates/deletes, scoped MongoDB mutations, and ordinary Redis writes |
| Full access | Also permits broad updates/deletes, DDL, `TRUNCATE`, MongoDB destructive operations, and Redis `FLUSH*` |

**Allowed connections** controls which stable connection IDs MCP can list or resolve. Connection-level read-only protection, production protection, database credentials, and the allowlist remain upper bounds in every mode.

Conditions such as `WHERE TRUE`, `WHERE 1 = 1`, `_id: {$exists: true}`, complementary predicates, and opaque MongoDB filters remain high risk. Unknown Redis commands also fail closed.

Legacy connection scope variables can still narrow the DBX allowlist for existing client configurations:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbx-production-scope": {
      "command": "dbx-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_NAME": "production-postgres",
        "DBX_MCP_SCOPE_DATABASE": "analytics"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_ID`, comma-separated `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_IDS`, or `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_NAME`. ID scopes take precedence over the name scope. The scoped database is optional.

## Safety

Choose **Read only**, **Data read/write**, or **Full access** in DBX instead of placing permission flags in client configuration. Updated servers do not let `DBX_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES` or `DBX_MCP_ALLOW_DANGEROUS_SQL` widen the DBX policy. For upgrade compatibility, `DBX_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES=0` (or `false`) keeps MCP read-only until a central policy is saved for the first time; the legacy permission variables are ignored afterward.

MongoDB update/delete operations require a verifiably effective filter unless Full access is enabled. Aggregation stages such as `$out` and `$merge` are treated as high-risk writes.

SQL text is not included in normal MCP errors or logged by default. Enable temporary diagnostics with `DBX_MCP_DEBUG_SQL=1` and disable it after troubleshooting.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DBX_DATA_DIR` | Override the local DBX data directory |
| `DBX_SESSION_IDLE_TTL_SECS` | Stateful session idle timeout in positive whole seconds (default: `1800`). Invalid, zero, negative or unrepresentable values use the default. Applies to transaction-owned connections too; restart the MCP host after changing it. |
| `DBX_WEB_URL` | Use a DBX Web/Docker backend |
| `DBX_WEB_PASSWORD` | Authenticate to the DBX Web backend |
| `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` | Standard system proxy variables for DBX Web requests; empty value means no proxy. Auth via `http://user:pass@host:port` |
| `NO_PROXY` | Standard comma-separated bypass list for the proxy above |
| `DBX_WEB_HEADERS` | JSON object of extra HTTP headers for DBX Web requests, e.g. `{"Authorization":"Bearer token"}` |
| `DBX_WEB_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` | `1`/`true` disables TLS certificate verification for self-signed backends |
| `DBX_WEB_CA_CERT` | PEM/DER CA file to trust for DBX Web TLS verification |
| `DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN` | Enable native DBX Web Streamable HTTP MCP with this bearer token |
| `DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN_FILE` | Read the native DBX Web MCP token from a file; cannot be combined with `DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN` |
| `DBX_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Required comma-separated public Host authorities for native DBX Web MCP |
| `DBX_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated browser Origins allowed for native DBX Web MCP |
| `DBX_MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` (default) or `streamable-http` for the native server |
| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_HOST` | Native HTTP bind address (default: `127.0.0.1`) |
| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_PORT` | Native HTTP bind port (default: `5225`) |
| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_PATH` | Native HTTP endpoint path (default: `/mcp`) |
| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` | Bearer token required by native Streamable HTTP |
| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN_FILE` | Read the native HTTP bearer token from a file; cannot be combined with `DBX_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` |
| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOW_REMOTE` | Set to `1` together with `--http-allow-remote` before a non-loopback bind is allowed |
| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Required Host authority allowlist for a non-loopback native bind |
| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Required browser Origin allowlist for a non-loopback native bind |
| `DBX_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES` | Upgrade compatibility only: `0`/`false` keeps an unconfigured policy read-only |
| `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_ID` | Compatibility scope for one connection ID |
| `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_IDS` | Compatibility scope for multiple connection IDs |
| `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_NAME` | Restrict tools to one connection name |
| `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_DATABASE` | Restrict tools to one database |
| `DBX_MCP_DEBUG_SQL` | Include SQL in temporary diagnostics |
| `DBX_MCP_BINARY` | Override the native binary used by the npm launcher |

## Troubleshooting

### Optional platform package was not installed

Reinstall without `--no-optional`:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @dbx-app/mcp-server
npm install -g @dbx-app/mcp-server@latest
```

Verify the current Node platform:

```bash
node -p 'process.platform + "-" + process.arch'
```

### Unsupported Linux distribution

The published Linux packages target glibc. Alpine Linux uses musl by default and is not currently supported.

### `dbx.db` cannot be found

Set `DBX_DATA_DIR` to the directory containing `dbx.db`, not to the database file itself.

### Desktop action says DBX is not running

Database queries can run without the desktop application when the connection is supported locally. `dbx_open_table` and `dbx_execute_and_show` intentionally require DBX desktop to be running.

### Agent/JDBC database cannot start

Open DBX Driver Manager and install/update the matching database agent and JRE. The standalone MCP binary does not redistribute every proprietary JDBC driver.

### `better-sqlite3` or Node ABI error

The Rust MCP runtime does not depend on `better-sqlite3`. This error normally indicates an older MCP version or the separate TypeScript-based `@dbx-app/cli` package. Upgrade MCP with:

```bash
npm install -g @dbx-app/mcp-server@latest
```

## Development

Run the Rust server from source:

```bash
cargo run -p dbx-mcp --no-default-features
```

Run tests:

```bash
cargo test -p dbx-mcp --no-default-features
pnpm --filter @dbx-app/mcp-server test
```

Build a release binary:

```bash
cargo build --release -p dbx-mcp --no-default-features
```

## DBX CLI

`@dbx-app/cli` is a separate terminal-oriented package and currently remains TypeScript/Node.js based:

```bash
npm install -g @dbx-app/cli
dbx connections list --json
dbx query local "select 1" --json
```

`dbx_execute_query` 支持可选参数 `max_rows`（取值 1–1000，默认 100；越界值会被夹取到范围内，而不是报错）。该参数仅对 SQL 连接生效：MongoDB shell 命令始终最多返回 100 行，路由到批量执行器的多语句脚本每条语句最多返回 100 行。

启用 `mq-admin` 后，`dbx_peek_messages` 可在本地和 Web 模式下读取 Kafka Topic。参数为 `connection_id` 或 `connection_name`、`topic`、可选 `count`（1–100，默认 20）、`start_position`（默认 `latest`，也支持 `earliest`、`offset`）及可选的非负 `partition`。仅 offset 模式必须且允许指定非负 `offset`，未指定分区时该位点应用于所有分区。JSON 结果保留 base64 消息体和元数据，通过 `incomplete` 标记底层不完整读取，通过 `outputTruncated` 标记因 256 KiB 输出预算而省略整条消息。工具遵守连接和工具范围，允许只读与生产连接读取，不提交消费位点，不支持其他 MQ 类型或持续订阅。

`dbx_list_databases` 只返回该连接 MCP 数据库范围内允许访问的名称。`dbx_send_message` 仅在 Server 构建时包含消息队列支持时可用。

Salesforce 连接通过 `dbx_execute_query` 执行 SOQL，通过 `dbx_list_tables` 列出对象。`dbx_execute_batch` 与 `dbx_open_session` 会被拒绝：SOQL 只读，且每次调用都是无状态 REST 请求，没有可固定的会话。写入记录是两步确认操作——`dbx_salesforce_prepare_write` 返回摘要和一次性 `confirm_token`（5 分钟后过期），由人确认该摘要后，`dbx_salesforce_apply_write` 才会发送那条已准备好的语句。准备写入需要在 DBX 设置 → MCP 中为该连接开启 **允许 DML**（默认关闭），且 Salesforce 无法回滚已应用的写入。

### Resources

支持 MCP Resources 的客户端可以读取连接目录，并通过模板获取数据库元数据：

| Resource URI | 说明 |
| --- | --- |
| `dbx://connections` | 当前 MCP 范围内可见的连接 |
| `dbx://connections/{connection_id}/databases` | 指定连接中可见的数据库 |
| `dbx://connections/{connection_id}/tables{?database,schema}` | 可选数据库或 Schema 中的表和视图 |
| `dbx://connections/{connection_id}/table-schema{?database,schema,table}` | 指定表的字段定义；`table` 为必填参数 |

Resource 的发现和读取会复用对应 Tool 的白名单，以及连接、分组、数据库和运行时范围限制。查询参数值必须进行 URI 编码。SQL 执行和所有可写操作仍只通过 Tool 提供。

### 本地数据目录

- macOS：`~/Library/Application Support/com.dbx.app/dbx.db`
- Linux：`~/.local/share/com.dbx.app/dbx.db`
- Windows：`%APPDATA%\com.dbx.app\dbx.db`

通过 `DBX_DATA_DIR` 覆盖默认目录。Windows 便携版应指向 `DBX.exe` 同级、包含 `dbx.db` 的 `data` 文件夹。

### DBX Web / Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbx": {
      "command": "dbx-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "DBX_WEB_URL": "https://dbx.example.com",
        "DBX_WEB_PASSWORD": "Web 登录密码"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Web 模式不会读取本机 DBX 桌面存储，也不会暴露桌面 UI 工具。

DBX Web 请求遵循标准系统代理环境变量：https 地址读取 `HTTPS_PROXY`/`https_proxy`，http 地址读取 `HTTP_PROXY`/`http_proxy`，`ALL_PROXY`/`all_proxy` 作为兜底，`NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` 作为绕过列表。代理值为空或未设置时直连（不走代理）。需要认证的代理使用标准 `user:password@host:port` URL 形式，例如 `http://admin:admin123@127.0.0.1:7890`。如需为每次 DBX Web 请求附加自定义请求头（例如网关前的令牌认证），将 `DBX_WEB_HEADERS` 设置为 JSON 对象，键为请求头名称、值为字符串，例如 `{"Authorization":"Bearer <token>"}`，该头会附加到包括认证在内的每个请求。

### 原生 Streamable HTTP

原生 Server 默认使用 stdio。需要直接提供本机 Streamable HTTP 服务时，启动时传入 Bearer Token：

```bash
DBX_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN=replace-with-a-long-random-secret dbx-mcp-server --http
```

默认监听 `http://127.0.0.1:5225/mcp`。在支持 HTTP 的 MCP 客户端中填写该 URL，并携带 `Authorization: Bearer <token>`：

```json
{
  "type": "http",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5225/mcp",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer replace-with-a-long-random-secret"
  }
}
```

默认回环地址仅允许同一台电脑上的客户端访问。监听非回环地址时，必须同时设置 `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`、传入 `--http-allow-remote`，并提供非空的 `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` 和 `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` 白名单。Host authority 与浏览器 Origin 均应使用精确的公网值。

DBX Web 可以通过现有 Web 监听器提供原生 Streamable HTTP，无需额外开放第二个端口。单实例且启用 Web 登录密码时，可在 **设置 → MCP → HTTP 服务**配置公网 Host 白名单并启用；生成的 Token 存在加密 Secret 存储中，可在页面轮换。多实例或部署管理场景仍使用 `DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN`（或 `DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN_FILE`）和 `DBX_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`；部署 Secret 优先，页面只读。容器映射为 `4225:4224` 时，端点为 `http://localhost:4225/mcp`：

```yaml
environment:
  DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN: replace-with-a-long-random-secret
  DBX_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS: localhost:4225
ports:
  - "4225:4224"
```

客户端必须携带 `Authorization: Bearer <DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN>`。浏览器客户端还需要在 `DBX_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` 中填写精确 Origin。反向代理添加路径前缀时，设置 `DBX_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`，端点会变为 `<base-path>/mcp`。原生 HTTP 与 `DBX_WEB_URL` 的 stdio 适配方式可以并存，并共享同一份 DBX 策略。

### Agent/JDBC 数据库

达梦、金仓KingbaseES、Oracle、DB2、Hive、Trino、Snowflake、SAP HANA 等数据库通过 DBX Java Agent/JDBC 基础设施运行，而不是通过 Node.js 数据库驱动运行。

npm 和 GitHub Release 中的原生 MCP 文件不会捆绑所有厂商的专有 JDBC Driver。请先通过 DBX Driver Manager 安装对应 Agent 和 JRE，或提供兼容的 DBX Agent 目录。

### DBX 管理的 MCP 策略

DBX 在 **设置 → MCP** 中保存一份权威策略，并在每次请求时重新读取：

| 权限模式 | 允许的操作 |
| --- | --- |
| 只读 | 查询和元数据读取 |
| 数据读写 | 普通插入、带有效过滤条件的更新/删除、范围明确的 MongoDB 修改和普通 Redis 写入 |
| 完全访问 | 额外允许大范围更新/删除、DDL、`TRUNCATE`、MongoDB 破坏性操作和 Redis `FLUSH*` |

**允许访问的连接** 决定 MCP 可以列出和解析哪些稳定连接 ID。连接自身只读、生产库保护、数据库账号权限和 allowlist 在任何模式下都是权限上限。

`WHERE TRUE`、`WHERE 1 = 1`、`_id: {$exists: true}`、互补条件或不透明 MongoDB 过滤器仍按高风险处理。未知 Redis 命令也会失败关闭。

旧连接 scope 变量可继续兼容读取，但只能进一步收窄 DBX allowlist：

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbx-production-scope": {
      "command": "dbx-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_NAME": "production-postgres",
        "DBX_MCP_SCOPE_DATABASE": "analytics"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

可使用 `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_ID`、逗号分隔的 `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_IDS` 或 `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_NAME`。ID scope 优先于名称 scope；作用域模式会隐藏连接增删和桌面 UI 工具。

### SQL 和命令安全

请在 DBX 中选择 **只读**、**数据读写** 或 **完全访问**，不要在客户端配置中放置权限开关。新版 Server 不允许 `DBX_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES` 或 `DBX_MCP_ALLOW_DANGEROUS_SQL` 放宽 DBX 中央策略。为兼容升级，在中央策略首次保存前，`DBX_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES=0`（或 `false`）仍会保持 MCP 只读；策略保存后旧权限变量即被忽略。

MongoDB 更新和删除在未启用完全访问时必须提供可验证有效的 filter；`$out`、`$merge` 聚合阶段按高风险写操作处理。

### 环境变量

| 变量 | 用途 |
| --- | --- |
| `DBX_DATA_DIR` | 覆盖本地 DBX 数据目录 |
| `DBX_SESSION_IDLE_TTL_SECS` | 有状态会话空闲超时，单位为正整数秒，默认 `1800`。非法值、零、负数或无法表示的时长回退默认值；同样适用于事务专属连接。修改后需重启 MCP 宿主进程。 |
| `DBX_WEB_URL` | 使用 DBX Web/Docker 后端 |
| `DBX_WEB_PASSWORD` | DBX Web 登录密码 |
| `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` | DBX Web 请求的标准系统代理变量；空值表示不走代理。认证格式 `http://user:pass@host:port` |
| `NO_PROXY` | 上述代理的标准逗号分隔绕过列表 |
| `DBX_WEB_HEADERS` | DBX Web 请求附加的请求头 JSON 对象，例如 `{"Authorization":"Bearer token"}` |
| `DBX_WEB_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` | `1`/`true` 时跳过 TLS 证书验证（用于自签名后端） |
| `DBX_WEB_CA_CERT` | DBX Web TLS 验证时信任的 PEM/DER CA 文件 |
| `DBX_WEB_MCP_TOKEN` | 使用该 Bearer Token 启用原生 DBX Web Streamable HTTP MCP |

| `DBX_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | 原生 DBX Web MCP 必填：允许的公网 Host authority，逗号分隔 |
| `DBX_WEB_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | 原生 DBX Web MCP 的浏览器 Origin 白名单，逗号分隔 |
| `DBX_MCP_TRANSPORT` | 原生 Server 传输方式：`stdio`（默认）或 `streamable-http` |
| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_HOST` | 原生 HTTP 监听地址（默认：`127.0.0.1`） |

| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | 监听非回环地址时必填的 Host authority 白名单 |
| `DBX_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | 监听非回环地址时必填的浏览器 Origin 白名单 |
| `DBX_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES` | 仅用于升级兼容：`0`/`false` 使尚未配置的策略保持只读 |
| `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_ID` | 兼容旧配置：限制到指定连接 ID |
| `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_IDS` | 兼容旧配置：限制到多个连接 ID |
| `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_CONNECTION_NAME` | 限制到指定连接名称 |
| `DBX_MCP_SCOPE_DATABASE` | 限制到指定数据库 |

### 常见问题

**提示平台 optional package 未安装**

重新安装并确保没有使用 `--no-optional`：

```bash
npm uninstall -g @dbx-app/mcp-server
npm install -g @dbx-app/mcp-server@latest
```

**提示找不到 `dbx.db`**

将 `DBX_DATA_DIR` 设置为包含 `dbx.db` 的目录，而不是数据库文件路径。

**提示 DBX 未运行**

普通数据库查询不一定需要启动 DBX；只有桌面 UI 工具和仍需 bridge 的连接需要 DBX 运行。

**Agent 数据库无法启动**

通过 DBX Driver Manager 安装或更新对应数据库 Agent、JDBC Driver 和 JRE。

**出现 `better-sqlite3` 或 Node ABI 错误**

Rust MCP 不依赖 `better-sqlite3`。请升级 MCP；如果错误来自 `@dbx-app/cli`，则属于当前仍为 TypeScript 的独立 CLI 包。

### 开发和测试

```bash
cargo run -p dbx-mcp --no-default-features
cargo test -p dbx-mcp --no-default-features
pnpm --filter @dbx-app/mcp-server test
cargo build --release -p dbx-mcp --no-default-features
```

### DBX CLI

`@dbx-app/cli` 是独立的终端包，目前仍使用 TypeScript/Node.js：

```bash
npm install -g @dbx-app/cli
dbx connections list --json
```
