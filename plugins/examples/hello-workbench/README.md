# DBX Hello Workbench plugin

This example exercises the complete manifest v1 path instead of mocking a contribution preview:

- native Rust sidecar built with `dbx-plugin-sdk`;
- protocol handshake and concurrent JSON-RPC requests;
- saved `connection-provider` with common/config/secret field bindings;
- test, connect, and disconnect lifecycle;
- per-connection backend registry;
- asynchronous connection/progress events;
- sandboxed workbench UI using `window.dbxPlugin`;
- declarative AI recommendation chips for the active workbench resource;
- workbench-to-sidecar RPC plus a read-only filesystem contribution rendered by DBX's host-owned file manager;
- `mcp/tools` / `mcp/call` tools for the built-in DBX AI assistant: `hello_greet` is declared read-only, `hello_set_greeting` changes state and therefore asks the user first;
- unsigned `.dbxp` candidate packaging plus separate repository signing;
- automated install-to-uninstall smoke runner.

The reusable smoke executables live at `crates/dbx-core/examples/plugin_package_smoke.rs` (package lifecycle) and `crates/dbx-core/examples/plugin_ai_tools_smoke.rs` (AI tool discovery and calls through the host) so they share DBX's workspace lockfile and dependency patches.

## Build an unsigned development package

From the DBX repository root:

```bash
node plugins/examples/hello-workbench/package.mjs
```

The package is written to:

```text
plugins/examples/hello-workbench/dist/
  dbx.example.hello-1.0.0-<target>.dbxp
  dbx.example.hello-1.0.0-<target>.artifact.json
```

The `.artifact.json` file contains the target, candidate URL, package SHA-256, and size used by review and multi-platform release aggregation. It intentionally contains no `signingKeyId`.

In DBX, open **Plugin Center**, enable **Allow unsigned development package**, and install the `.dbxp`.

## Use the example

1. Select **DBX Hello Workbench** in the plugin center.
2. Create a **Hello connection**.
3. Fill the host, port, greeting, and optional example token.
4. Click **Test**.
5. Click **Save & Open**.
6. Invoke the sidecar from the workbench.
7. Click **Open host files** to browse and preview the virtual `hello:/` filesystem without plugin-owned file-browser UI.
8. In Plugin Center → Installed, turn on **Built-in AI tools** for the plugin, keep the Hello connection open, and ask the AI assistant in Agent mode to greet someone or change the greeting. The greeting change pauses for your approval.
9. Open the AI assistant from the workbench and click the **Inspect current workbench** recommendation to send a prompt immediately.

The example token is persisted through `connection_secrets`; the raw connection `config_json` contains only an empty placeholder. The iframe receives the saved connection ID, never the token.

## Run the real package smoke test

```bash
node plugins/examples/hello-workbench/smoke.mjs
```

The smoke runner performs:

```text
build package
→ install into a temporary plugin store
→ verify manifest compatibility
→ read plugin and connection-provider icon assets
→ start and initialize the native sidecar
→ test the provider connection
→ connect the saved plugin connection
→ invoke hello/greet
→ list and preview files through the typed filesystem host API
→ observe connection and progress events
→ disconnect
→ stop the sidecar
→ uninstall
```

To reuse an already-built package:

```bash
node plugins/examples/hello-workbench/smoke.mjs \
  plugins/examples/hello-workbench/dist/dbx.example.hello-1.0.0-darwin-arm64.dbxp
```

To verify a repository-signed package with marketplace policy, provide the trusted repository public keys:

```bash
DBX_PLUGIN_SMOKE_TRUSTED_KEYS_JSON='{"example-repository":"BASE64_32_BYTE_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY"}' \
node plugins/examples/hello-workbench/smoke.mjs \
  plugins/examples/hello-workbench/dist/dbx.example.hello-1.0.0-darwin-arm64.signed.dbxp
```

## Sign as a custom repository operator

Official plugin authors skip this section because DBX Store signs approved candidates. To exercise the custom-repository flow, generate or load a repository key and sign the already-built candidate:

```bash
dbx-plugin keygen example-repository
source .dbx-repository-signing-key.env
node plugins/examples/hello-workbench/repository-sign.mjs
```

The script writes a `.signed.dbxp`, creates final artifact metadata containing `signingKeyId`, and refreshes the example catalog entry. Add the corresponding Base64 public key under **Plugin Center → Custom repository trust** before installing from that catalog.

Do not put the private seed in the repository or package. Distribute the repository public key through a channel independent from the `.dbxp` download.

Run the complete temporary-key flow without modifying the example catalog:

```bash
node plugins/examples/hello-workbench/repository-smoke.mjs
```

This builds an unsigned candidate, generates an ephemeral repository key outside the workspace, signs the reviewed candidate, installs it with strict signature policy, exercises assets/actions/connections/filesystem/events, uninstalls it, and removes temporary keys and Cargo targets.

Set `DBX_PLUGIN_OUTPUT_DIR` when automation should place candidate outputs outside the example `dist/` directory.

## Connection request shape

The backend lifecycle receives the hydrated connection and the final DBX transport endpoint:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "id": "dbx.example.hello.connection",
    "databaseType": "hello"
  },
  "connection": {
    "id": "saved-connection-id",
    "db_type": "plugin",
    "plugin_id": "dbx.example.hello",
    "plugin_connection_provider": "dbx.example.hello.connection",
    "plugin_connection_type": "hello",
    "external_config": {
      "greeting": "Hello"
    },
    "connection_secrets": {
      "api_token": "hydrated only for the backend"
    }
  },
  "runtime": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 22
  }
}
```

The workbench context is intentionally smaller:

```json
{
  "connectionId": "saved-connection-id",
  "providerId": "dbx.example.hello.connection",
  "connectionType": "hello"
}
```

## Adapt it for a real plugin

- SSH/SFTP: switch to `stdio-framed`, keep PTY/SFTP sessions in a backend registry, and use binary channels for terminal/transfer data.
- OpenDAL: keep credentials in the connection provider, implement filesystem methods in the backend, and let DBX own generic file-manager UI.
- Other tools: add contributions rather than adding a new DBX database enum variant or importing plugin Vue code into the main window.
